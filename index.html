                      Steve Wozniak. *Creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive 
                      revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones,

                <h6>Family</h6>
                <h5>
                    Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي).
His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that his birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali. He was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.
Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was born and raised in an Arab Muslim household in Homs, Syria. As an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon,
 he was a student activist and was imprisoned for his political activities. He pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Schieble, 
an American Catholic of German and Swiss descent. Both of the same age, Jandali was a doctoral candidate and a teaching assistant for a course Schieble 
was taking.Novelist Mona Simpson, Jobs's biological sister, noted that Schieble's Catholic parents were unhappy that their daughter was with a Muslim.
Jobs's biographer Walter Isaacson states that Schieble's dying father "threatened to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah", so they remained an unmarried couple.
Paul Jobs was a Coast Guard mechanic. After leaving the Coast Guard, he married Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent, in 1946.
 An ectopic pregnancy led them to consider adoption in 1955. Hagopian's parents were survivors of the Armenian genocide.

                <h6>Innovations and designs </h6>
                <h5>
                    Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey
, and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied. He also learned from many references and sources, 
such as modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of Richard Sapper and Dieter Rams.[citation needed]
According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design..." Daniel Kottke, one of 
Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person."
He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual
 computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards, and packages.
 His contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the product". He and his industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.
 Most of these are design patents as opposed to utility patents or inventions; they are specific product designs such as both original and lamp-style iMacs, 
and PowerBook G4 Titanium. He holds 43 issued US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with "magnification" feature was issued the 
day before he died. Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,
 Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time 
marketing executive and confidant Joanna Hoffman, known as one of the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand up to Jobs while also
 engaging with him.Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.
 He despised the oxygen monitor on his finger, and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.
Since his death, he has won 141 patents, more than most inventors during their lifetimes. He holds over 450 patents in total.
